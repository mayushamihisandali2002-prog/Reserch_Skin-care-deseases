FINAL SKIN TYPE SYSTEM FLOW (IMAGE + QUESTIONNAIRE FUSION)

Input:
  - Facial selfie image
  - User answers to a short yes/no questionnaire

Step 1: Image Model Inference
  - Preprocess image (resize 224x224, normalize with ImageNet mean/std)
  - ConvNeXt model outputs probability distribution:
      P_img = [P(oily), P(dry), P(combination)]

Step 2: Conditional Questionnaire
  - Q1: "Does your face become oily/shiny within 2–3 hours after washing?"
  - If Q1 = No:
      Q2: "Does your skin feel dry/tight/flaky after washing?"
    Else (Q1 = Yes):
      Q2: "Is oiliness mainly in the T-zone while cheeks are normal/dry?"

  - Convert answers into questionnaire probabilities:
      P_q = [P(oily), P(dry), P(combination)]

Step 3: Weighted Fusion
  - Combine both probability vectors using:
      P_final = alpha * P_img + (1 - alpha) * P_q
  - Final prediction = argmax(P_final)

Output:
  - Final skin type class and confidence (P_final)
